How to Play Chess
1. The Board and Pieces
Chess is played on an 8x8 board with 64 squares, alternating in color (usually black and white). Each player starts with 16 pieces:

1 King
1 Queen
2 Rooks
2 Knights
2 Bishops
8 Pawns
Each type of piece moves in a specific way.

2. Setup
Back Row (closest to the player): Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook.
Front Row: 8 Pawns.
White pieces are always set up at the bottom, and black pieces at the top.

3. Objective
The main objective is to checkmate your opponent’s King. This means the King is in a position to be captured (in check) and there is no legal move the player can make to escape the threat of capture.

4. Piece Movements
King: Moves one square in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
Queen: Moves any number of squares in any direction.
Rook: Moves any number of squares vertically or horizontally.
Bishop: Moves any number of squares diagonally.
Knight: Moves in an "L" shape (two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular). Knights can jump over other pieces.
Pawn: Moves forward one square but captures diagonally. On its first move, a pawn can move forward two squares. When a pawn reaches the other side of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a King).
5. Special Moves
Castling: A move involving the King and a Rook. The King moves two squares towards the Rook, and the Rook moves to the square next to the King. Castling can only happen if neither piece has moved before, there are no pieces between them, and the King is not in check.
En Passant: A special pawn capture. If a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent’s pawn, the opponent’s pawn can capture it as if it had only moved one square.
Pawn Promotion: When a pawn reaches the farthest row from its starting position, it is promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight (usually a Queen).
6. Turns
Players take turns to move one piece at a time. The game starts with the player controlling the white pieces.

7. Winning the Game
You win the game by putting your opponent's King in checkmate. This means the King is under attack, and there is no legal move to escape the attack. The game can also end in a draw in several ways, including:

Stalemate: When the player to move has no legal moves and is not in check.
Insufficient Material: When neither player has enough pieces to force a checkmate.
Threefold Repetition: When the same position occurs three times with the same player to move.
50-Move Rule: If 50 moves pass without a pawn move or capture.
